What is a Zero-Day Vulnerability and How Can It Impact Businesses?Zero-day attacks come without warning. Such attacks can pose a high risk for a company or business if appropriate actions are not taken at the right time. It can even lead to loss of millions of dollars and put untold volumes of private info at risk.What is zero-day vulnerability?A zero-day vulnerability is a weakness within a computer network or software program that is unknown to the developers or parties responsible for patching the flaw.The term ‘zero’ here indicates the same-day window in which exploits often occur. For example, a global site host has released an updated version of the platform on a specific day. Within 30 minutes of the launch, a hacker has discovered a vulnerability in the new version before the site developers have time to suspend the launch and develop a patch.This weakness can easily be exploited on the same day of the discovery, thus resulting in a zero-day attack.How prevalent is it?According to aby Ponemon Institute, around 76% of the respondents claimed that the type of attacks suffered by their organizations in 2018, were new or unknown zero-day attacks.With the passing years, experts predict that the frequency of these threats and attacks is only going to worsen. Cybersecurity Ventures hasthat by 2021, there will be one new exploit every day.How does it occur?A zero-day attack happens once the software or hardware vulnerability is exploited and attackers release malware before a developer has an opportunity to create a patch to fix the vulnerability.Let’s take a look at the common zero-day attackHow to tackle it?Organizations at risk from such exploits can employ several means of detection such as using virtual local area networks (LANs), firewalls, a secure Wi-Fi system, and more. This can help them prevent wireless malware attacks.Other preventive steps include:Also, individuals can minimize the risk by keeping their operating system up to date and using websites with SSL (Security Socket Layer) protection. SSL secures the information being sent between the user and the site.EVENTSWrite to us atFollow us onVisit Us
 Understanding the Difference Between DoS and DDoS AttacksA DoS attack is similar to a DDoS attack, except they take very different forms. DoS attacks exist in one of two broad classes, Denial-of-Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS).DoS attacksDoS attacks are perpetrated by a single attacker and their goal is to make an application, service or machine unavailable. This is done by either flooding it with more requests than it can handle or otherwise consuming resources or processing in such a way that legitimate requests cannot be handled.Within DoS, there are two primary categories:DDoS attacksDDoS attacks are denial-of-service attacks in which more than one attacking machines participate. The proliferation of IoT devices with poor security controls has led to a massive rise in such attacks including botnets such as Mirai.The operators of these botnets can even rent them out to other malicious actors to fuel devastating DDoS attacks - such as the one against Dyn that crippled large parts of the internet in 2016.DDoS attacks can also be perpetrated by large groups of active users using simple tools like in the DDoS attack by the Anonymous hacker group. The hacker group had used a free internet tool calledto conduct online attacks against computer systems. The group had caused multi million-pound losses to a number of firms, including PayPal and Ministry of Sound, as a revenge for the backlash against WikiLeaks.The bottom lineWith the increase in the dependency of smart devices among the consumers, it is estimated that the DDoS attacks are not going away anytime. Hence, organizations manufacturing and selling all IoT and consumer smart devices need to adhere to specific security requirements to prevent cybercriminals from building an army of botnets.
 Ryuk Ransomware behind Attack on Florida Library SystemEmails obtained through a public records request show that the strain of ransomware used against Volusia County libraries last month is the same kind behinds other attacks on government systems. (TNS) — The cyberattack that took down public-access computers at Volusia County, Fla., libraries last month involvedthat has elicited millions of dollars in ransom payments from governments and large businesses.Volusia County officials say they've referred the attack to law enforcement, but would not say which agency is investigating. Emails provided in response to a public-record request indicate the library computers were infected by Ryuk ransomware. "Because it's under investigation, we have no comment at this time," said Kevin Captain, a county spokesman in an emailed response to a question about ransom.Captain confirmed the county's insurance deductible is $100,000. "Later that day, in another email, Whiting says the IT department has detected "a ten-fold increase in attempted attacks over the past month or so. "Twenty servers and about 600 computers were encrypted — essentially locked up — by the ransomware. Volusia County IT staff shut down and disconnected all the computers from the county network. "It is believed sensitive data is not at risk due to (redacted)," Heer wrote, adding that would have to be confirmed. "Those who've used public-access computers on a network that's been hit by Ryuk probably don't have much to worry about," said Brett Callow, a threat analyst with Emsisoft, a New Zealand-based anti-malware company. "The Ryuk operators have not been known to steal data. Where many cyber criminals demand $10,000 to remove the encryption on computer systems, Ryuk operators "demand an average of $288,000 for the release of systems. "Yet another cyber defense firm, CrowdStrike,as "Wizard Spider," a Russia-based criminal group.Callow said exactly who's deploying Ryuk remains an open question. "There's speculation that the group behind Ryuk – and it does appear to be a single group – has Russian ties, but it is just speculation. Attribution is always extremely hard," he wrote in an emailed response to questions. "For example, some ransomware contains language exclusions and will not encrypt files if the operating system uses one of a number of specified languages – (post-Soviet) countries, Iran, etc.," he wrote. "Unlike other ransomware, which contain flaws in the encryption allowing security companies to create tools to recover data without needing to pay ransom, Ryuk has no such flaws, Callow said. "The encryption is perfectly implemented and, consequently, the only way to recover data is to restore it from backups (assuming they were not deleted/encrypted during the attacks) or to pay the ransom," Callow said.©2020 The News-Journal, Daytona Beach, Fla.

 SearchSearch24 malicious apps with combined downloads of over 300 million removed from Google Play Store7 February 2020Google, Play Store, malicious apps, TCL apps, Google removes 24 malicious apps, malware apps, Google Play Store malware appsEven though Google has removed these apps from the Play Store, a large number of users will still have these installed on their smartphones.The Chinese company named Shenzhen HAWK is behind 24 apps which are known for containing malware and rogueware according to a new report by VPNPro. These apps have over 382 million combined installs and now have been removed from the Play Store.Google in a statement toForbes, said that they have removed all of the 24 apps in the Shenzhen network from the Play Store and that "If we find behaviour that violates our policies, we take action. "To which Shenzhen Hawk’s parent company, TCL Corporation responded saying that they "understand Google’s actions in removing all of the Shenzhen apps and are actively working with them to better understand their concerns." Some would launch a hidden browser and click on ads. Some would harvest user data and store it on a server in China. These were just some of the issues that were taking place.These malicious apps include: Super Cleaner developed by Hawk App, Hi Security developed by Hi Security, Candy developed by ViewYeah Studio, Super Battery developed by Hawk App, Gallery developed by Alcatel Innovative Lab, Hi VPN developed by Hi Security, Net Master developed by Hi Security, filemanager developed by mie-alcatel.support.Apps that were not in Play Store: Calculator, Joy Recorder developed by mie-alcatel.support, Weather developed by mie-alcatel.support, Launcher developed by mie-alcatel.support.Even though Google has removed these apps from the Play Store, a large number of users will still have these installed on their smartphones. If you are one of these users, we recommend that you immediately uninstall these from your smartphone.Apps under Shenzhen HAWK have a history of malware, rogueware, or unethical practices.

The attack chain employed a known method called “VBS Stomping” to avoid detection.According to researchers at FireEye, the campaigns, aimed at enabling further malware infections and espionage efforts, were initiated via phishing emails with attached documents containing malicious macros. The emails were coming from fake domains that were geared to add legitimacy to the messages, resulting in a convincing theme running throughout the proceedings.For instance, the first campaign, initially spotted on Jan. 7, carried a tax theme (subject line: “Tax Return File,” with IRS-related text in the message). This was reinforced through the use of a CPA-themed domain used in the email addresses: rogerveCPS [dot]com. The attached document meanwhile mimicked an H&R Block-related tax form.Another campaign, which started on Jan. 28, had a recruiting theme, with messages sent from various emails that all used the domain name agent4career[dot]com. The subject line and message body in this case referenced an “employment candidate with experience in the financial sector,” according to the FireEye research,– and the attached document purported to be the person’s resume.“One of the more notable characteristics of this activity was the consistency in themes used for domain registration, lure content, similarities in malicious document macro content and targeting,” according to the research.VBA Stomping to Hide Malicious MacrosAcross campaigns, the attached phishing documents used the “VBA Stomping” tactic to hide their malicious macros. The term refers to “the manipulation of Office documents where the source code of a macro is made to mismatch the pseudo-code (p-code) of the document,” according to FireEye.P-code is the natural language translation of programming code – essentially, it describes in readable terms what the code is programmed to do.This mismatching technique has a few benefits when it comes to evading detection. “Static analysis tools focusing on VBA macro source extraction may be fooled into a benign assessment of a document bearing malicious p-code,” according to FireEye’s analysis. And, “when VBA source is removed, and a document is opened in a version of Office for which the p-code was not compiled to execute, a macro will not execute correctly, resulting in potential failed dynamic analysis.”However, some sophistication is required in order to use the tactic effectively, according to the firm: “An actor’s VBA stomped document containing benign VBA source but evil p-code must know the version of Office to build the p-code for, or their sample will not detonate properly. Additionally, if an actor sends a stomped document, and a user or researcher opens the macro in the Office editor, they will see malicious code.”In this case, the attackers got around those restrictions by making viewing the macro source impossible within Office. They did this by modifying the PROJECT stream of the document. Within the stream, a module is referenced but not defined – a method that requires a knowledge of the target’s machine and which is suitable for higher-end, more targeted activity.“[Now the] payloads have the additional burden of needing to fingerprint targets to enable successful execution,” according to FireEye’s report. “While actors with sufficient resources and creativity can no doubt account for these requirements, it is relevant to note that detections for these methodologies will likely yield more targeted activity.”The Minebridge PayloadThe ultimate goal of the document is to infect victims with the Minebridge backdoor. It’s a powerful piece of malware that gives attackers full control of the target environment. The FriendSpeak efforts “use spoofed sender addresses, Excel spreadsheets with embedded payloads and campaign-specific domains that masquerade as common technology services,” researchers said. The campaigns delivering Minebridge also appear to be significantly smaller in both volume and scope.Also, the campaigns delivering Minebridge continued even over Eastern Orthodox Christmas when Russian-speaking actors are commonly inactive; this was not the case for the FriendSpeak campaigns.“[This] may suggest TA505 actors speak Russian” while the Minebridge actors do not, FireEye researchers concluded. Nonetheless, the firm hasn’t ruled out the possibility that the Minebridge attackers are a subset of TA505, it said.Learn how Operational Technology and Information Technology systems are merging and changing security playbooks in this free Threatpost Webinar.

 With names such as Speed Clean and Super Clean, the apps masqueraded as utilities for optimizing device performance. Behind the scenes, they connected to servers that could download as many as 3,000 different malware variants on compromised devices. Once installed, the apps could log in to users’ Facebook and Google accounts to perform ad fraud. One place the campaign was not active was in China. When Trend Micro researchers modified geographic parameters to China, the apps didn’t do any malicious downloads. (Often, malware campaigns exclude the attackers’ countries of origin to prevent crackdowns by local authorities. )The apps participating in the campaign included:App NamePackageNo. Anubis is a piece of Android malware that’s known for its ingenuity. In mid-2018, researchers with IBM’s X-Force group documented a variety of Google Play apps that. In fact, it’s an APK file, which is the format typically used to install Android apps. Devices that are allowed to install apps from sources other than Google Play will display a fake Google Protect message that asks for the two innocuous privileges.When users click OK, the app disables Play Protect and gains 19 permissions, many of them highly sensitive. Once a user opens any of those apps, the malware uses an overlay screen to phish the account password for the app. The first is to be suspicious of apps available in Play. People should steer clear of apps that have relatively few users, come from obscure developers, or have user reviews that report dubious behaviors. Apps that provide minimal benefit or haven’t been used recently should always be uninstalled.As problematic as Google Play can be, it’s almost always even more risky to obtain apps from third-party sources (unless they’re from Amazon or a developer known to the user or the users’ employer).
